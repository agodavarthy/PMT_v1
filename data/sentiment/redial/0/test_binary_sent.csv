1,Same here. it was a pleasant surprise.. Have you seen Contact (2009) ? Arrival (2016) reminded me of it.
1,them sorry meant them.. The Fifth Element has a lot of comedy relief if you like that. Both the Blade Runner (1982) flicks are more serious and have Harrison Ford.
1,Science fiction.. Just saw Arrival (2016) it was good, not what I was expecting but good.
1,I think I'd want to see Airplane! (1980) , and I saw part of Office Space (1999) before and liked it a lot.. Another movie I really like is Ghost (1990) .
1,I am looking for a movie that is fun to watch and not too gruesome.. My favorite movie of all time might be Goodfellas (1990) .
1,both. I think I'd want to see Airplane! (1980) , and I saw part of Office Space (1999) before and liked it a lot.
1,Airplane! (1980) is great, it started a whole new comedy genre.. hmm, remember Ghost (1990) but don't think I saw it. Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) are funny if you like ghost movies. Or Next of Kin (1984) is my favorite Patrick Swayze movie.
1,I miss Patrick Swayze.. Airplane! (1980) is great, it started a whole new comedy genre.
1,My favorite movie of all time might be Goodfellas (1990) .. Ok, can work with that. How about Airplane! (1980) or Office Space (1999) but are good comedies, lol, I'd count Goodfellas (1990) as gruesome
1,I think I might like to see it. That sort of movie is great.. I saw The Boss Baby (2017) a while ago and it was weird, but still fun
1,I like both types. The Goonies (1985) is a Favorite, and Zootopia was pretty good. I haven't seen Moana (2016) was that good?. I haven't seen Moana (2016) yet, but it was recommended to me by a coworker
1,I saw The Boss Baby (2017) a while ago and it was weird, but still fun. I also liked The Secret Life of Pets (2016)
1,I haven't seen either of those, I'll add them to my list.. is The Boss Baby (2017) funny?
1,Yes, I like kids movies. Do you like classic ones like The Goonies (1985) or more modern animated films like Moana (2016) and Zootopia ?
1,Do you like classic ones like The Goonies (1985) or more modern animated films like Moana (2016) and Zootopia ?. I like both types. The Goonies (1985) is a Favorite, and Zootopia was pretty good. I haven't seen Moana (2016) was that good?
1,What fantasy movies do you like?. I really like movies like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)
1,I really like movies like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). What is Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017) about?
1,I'll add that to my list.. Oh, I forgot to mention Divergent (2014) as a similar series
1,It was a strange save the world type film. Do you like the The Maze Runner (2014) series?
1,Do you know any good fantasy movies?. I saw Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)
1,Do you know any similar movies?. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) was interesting too
1,Oh sweet! I can sure help you with that.. I like the old Die Hard (1988) and Under Siege (1992) movies
1,but something new would be okay too. True Grit (1969) is a great older western action movie. I love that one. As far as newer ones go, have you seen Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) ?
1,Which 1 would you recommend me watching first?. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) I heard has great reviews
1,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) I heard has great reviews. Probably Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) . It's a three hour long chase scene, which sounds silly, but it is constantly intense, and lots of excellent action. Plus Tom Hardy!
1,The Big Sick (2017) is about a Pakistani Man who falls in love with a white American woman. She falls into a coma for a bit and he deals with her parents and his family. It's actually very funny. Meet the Parents (2004) is a film thats in a similar vein.
1,Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) is a really good movie.. The Big Sick (2017) Was hilarious as well
1,Such as Deadpool (2016) or Superbad (2007) , those are two of my favorites.. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) is a really good movie.
1,Those both sound pretty hilarious. I will absolutely check them both out!. I have seen Meet the Parents (2004) and really liked it.
1,Yes! I am interested in some good comedies.. Such as Deadpool (2016) or Superbad (2007) , those are two of my favorites.
1,Anchorman is about an anchorman in the 70's dealing with a new female coworker, and his attemps to outshine her.. The Big Sick (2017) is about a Pakistani Man who falls in love with a white American woman. She falls into a coma for a bit and he deals with her parents and his family. It's actually very funny
1,But that would definitely make sense, he has a good sense of these kind of movies. He was an actor in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) a classic western.
1,Bye. As a bonus check out Tombstone (1993) my mom was actually in that movie.
1,As long as there is a cowboy hat and lots of action. Have you seen Unforgiven (1992)

1,Loved Eddie Murphy in that film. That was a great movie, and Eddie is a good actor. Have you seen Die Hard (1988) that is a great cop movie as well.
1,I also liked movies like The Warriors (1979) a cult classic. Rambo (2012) is also a movie with a strong macho type dude you might like.
1,Hello. Hey there I'm looking for some classic action type movies... maybe something like Beverly Hills Cop (1984)
1,I know a fair share, new or old?. Both! I love The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart.
1,Both! I love The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart.. My personal favorite is High Noon (1952) , that is one that never gets old for me. A good John Wayne one that I love is The Searchers (1956) !

1,Since you mentioned musicals. I enjoy a good zombie flick afterall! Though Alien (1979) and Predator (1987) are my go to's
1,Seems like misses more often than not. Well, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) is actually a scary musical that is fairly recent, now that I think about it.
1,Hi there! Know any good musicals?. Hi. Do you know of any good horror films like 28 Days Later (2002) ?
1,If you don't mind older scary movies. Cube (1997) holds up today.. I did see The Conjuring (2013) during the daytime. Cube (1997) was really interesting.
1,Sure!. Or Little Shop of Horrors (1986) ?
1,I'm doing well. thank you.. i also like animated films like WALL-E (2008)
1,i also like animated films like WALL-E (2008). Ok, let me see. Have you seen Earth to Echo (2014) or Mac and Me (1988) ?
1,I'm great, how are you?. I'm looking for a family film like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
1,Oh, I have not seen those. Was Earth to Echo (2014) with the little white robot?
1,Its about an American in Japan that is being hunted by ninjas. I suppose I could list a couple random suggestions too. I actually was chatting with one person that hadn't seen Stripes (1981) or Galaxy Quest (1999) for example.
1,It is a wonderful nostalgia. The Hunted (1995) is a great movie
1,And, I am always looking for suggestions :). I would have to say Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) I went with my dad when i was a kid
1,Yes, this is really helpful.. Thor before The Avengers (2012)
1,Well like a nerd I would say start with The Avengers (2012) and then of course Thor. I haven't seen those. Is The Avengers (2012) better tha n Thor ?
1,Umm It was bit in a graceful way. Well like a nerd I would say start with The Avengers (2012) and then of course Thor
1,Hello how are you. Have you seen Black Panther (2018)
1,I'll check them out.. But I also am biased and love marvel more but I enjoyed Justice League (2017) . I mean it has Thor in it but you should watch the individual films first but those are not too action packed
1,I loved it. Hi, I'm great. I haven't, was Black Panther (2018) action packed?
1,But I also am biased and love marvel more but I enjoyed Justice League (2017) . I mean it has Thor in it but you should watch the individual films first but those are not too action packed. Should I watch Thor before Justice League (2017) ?
1,Hi. Yes, right now I'm into coming of age movies.. I would recommend movies like The Breakfast Club (1985) or Stand by Me (1986) then.
1,I could also recommend Turbo Kid (2015) for another odd coming of age movie.. What happens in Turbo Kid (2015) ?
1,That sounds like a unique twist on the theme.. I could also recommend Turbo Kid (2015) for another odd coming of age movie.
1,I would recommend movies like The Breakfast Club (1985) or Stand by Me (1986) then.. If you are looking for something a bit more unorthodox Zombieland (2009) might work.
1,What is Zombieland (2009) about?. Zombieland (2009) is a zombie movie, but it focuses on a kid that is learning to survive on his own. Then meets a girl and develops as an individual.
1,I've seen The Breakfast Club (1985) but not Stand by Me (1986) . I'll look it up.. What is Zombieland (2009) about?
1,If you are looking for something a bit more unorthodox Zombieland (2009) might work.. I've seen The Breakfast Club (1985) but not Stand by Me (1986) . I'll look it up.
1,that one is also very great. Ooops, I meant A Quiet Place (2018)

1,lol its ok also a ggod movie. There is also The Conjuring 2 (2016)
1,Okay. What about It (2017) ?. saw it im more of a fan of the original It (1990)
1,I am not a fan of clowns LOL. Have you seen A Quiet Place to Kill (1970) I heard that is pretty scary
1,those two are great maybe they will like it. The Boss Baby (2017) is hilarious and even though it's a kid's movie, you'll find some hidden adult humor.
1,which is my problem lol. Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016) are great movies for any age! The graphics are great and really demand the attention
1,thank you for the recomendation. If anything, you could always go for the classics like The Little Mermaid (1989) or The Lion King (1994)
1,Finding Nemo (2003) and Finding Dory (2016) are great movies for any age! The graphics are great and really demand the attention. i was thinking Brave (2012) or Frozen but then i remembered i saw it yesterday
1,Can you please give me an idea of your tastes in movies so that I can find relevant recommendations?. hmm like The Notebook (2004) and Red Dawn (2012)
1,hmm like The Notebook (2004) and Red Dawn (2012). If you like Red Dawn (2012) then I recommend The Darkest Hour (2011) . Also a good recommendation of a similar movie to The Notebook (2004) is P.S. I Love You (2007) . Are either of these suitable?
1,yes very good keeps you on your toes all the way until the end.. The Jungle Book (2016)
1,I have seen An Officer and a Gentleman its so sad. Steel Magnolias (1989) was about a woman with diabetes and is getting married. Sally Fields plays in it. Dont want to spoil the ending

1,Do you know any?. Classic movie! If you want to watch another classic horror movie you should watch It (1990)
1,I will check that out!. If you're into movies with a lot of violence and blood I'd say check out Hostel (2011) and Purge (2012)
1,Classic movie! If you want to watch another classic horror movie you should watch It (1990). there is a new It (2017) movie which is pretty good but in my opinion the original one is so much better
1,there is a new It (2017) movie which is pretty good but in my opinion the original one is so much better. I've see It (2017) and the old one. I also enjoyed Get Out (2017)
1,Hello. I love a good horror movie. Like The Exorcist (1973)
1,Amazing movie! Makes you hold your breath. Hmm.... I think A Quiet Place (2018) sounds like a great one!
1,Can you suggest something else new?. Oh yes, Get Out (2017) is one of a kind movie! Wasn't scary but so good!
1,Oh yes, Get Out (2017) is one of a kind movie! Wasn't scary but so good!. Have you seen A Quiet Place (2018) ?
1,Have you seen A Quiet Place (2018) ?. The old It (1990) was really good. But, the new one was excellently done.
1,If you're into movies with a lot of violence and blood I'd say check out Hostel (2011) and Purge (2012). Those were okay. But, I will take your advise on A Quiet Place (2018)
1,The group of scientists went into space and accidentally went to a different dimension and a lot of crazy things started happening on that spaceship. They were just trying to figure out how to get back to their dimension. The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) sounds cool. I will watch that this evening.
1,The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) is a pretty good sci fi movie. I think I will add Underworld (2003) to my list of movies to watch.
1,It's about vampires and warewolfs. What about something for fictional. Maybe science fiction. Star Trek Beyond (2016) is nice.
1,What about something for fictional. Maybe science fiction. Star Trek Beyond (2016) is nice.. Have you watched Star Wars ?

1,who didn't. Oh yes, I've heard about Underworld (2003) .
1,Oh, it's a political movie. I guess it's OK.. If you're not in a mood for that you can check out Underworld (2003)
1,My kids are in LOVE with Finding Nemo (2003) ! But they haven't seen Toy Story (1995) That's a really good idea. I haven't seen The Land Before Time (1988) so that'll be something we can watch together!
1,10 &amp; 8. I just recently saw Moana (2016) , that was a good one of course
1,Oh I didn't even think of Moana (2016) ! i'll definitely add that to the list!. I REALLY liked The Iron Giant (1999) but the beginning might be slightly too scary for the younger one
0,We're open to anything really. so we'll add Spirited Away to the list also!. Anything Pixar is good, of course, The Incredibles (2004) , Monsters, Inc. (2001) Inc
1,Oh that reminds me! the squeal of The Incredibles (2004) comes out this summer! we'll definitely watch so we (mainly Me) can see the second one!. If you don't mind older films, I recommend the first The Land Before Time (1988) didn't really see the sequels, but heard they're not as great, but still good for kids

1,If you don't mind Anime, I recommend Spirited Away. We're open to anything really. so we'll add Spirited Away to the list also!
1,I can watch The Iron Giant (1999) just with the oldest. have mom/son time. If you don't mind Anime, I recommend Spirited Away

1,thanks. oh ya but the original King Kong (1933) is the best

1,oh ya monster movies are great. I liked the remake Godzilla (2017)
1,Hello! I'm looking for a good horror.. either psychological suspense like The Exorcist or something more wild and goofy like The Evil Dead (1981). Goofy I would suggest Shaun of the Dead (2004) . Really great movie.
1,Oh, I've seen that! And Hot Fuzz (2007) and the other one they did where they're bar hopping.. can't recall the name off-hand. Zombieland (2009) is one of my favorites.

1,I'm looking for a decent action movie.. got any good ideas?. some classics are Die Hard (1988)
1,i dont think, but maybe. I saw it on a wim one day and actually really liked it. I have seen Lucy (2014) kept cringing when I heard that whole &quot;We only use 10 percent of our brains&quot; craps... can Hollywood please quit repeating that BS! Still, the action was pretty neat
1,Hey, I've seen both of those! Was about to mention Die Hard (1988) before you did! Liked all of them but the last one.... but if you like newer there's stuff like Atomic Blonde (2017) or maybe The Expendables (2010)
1,I have not seen Red Sparrow.. is that a John Woo film? sounds familiar... just ignorw the actual science in Lucy (2014)
1,Recently saw Brick Mansions (2014) it was okay, but not much to talk about really.. Oh, loved Atomic Blonde (2017) Theron was awesome!
1,some classics are Die Hard (1988). and Lethal Weapon (1987)
1,Recently seen Dredd (2012) and thought that was pretty cool, like action/comedy type films as well like The Last Boy Scout (1991). Hey, I've seen both of those! Was about to mention Die Hard (1988) before you did! Liked all of them but the last one...
1,Oh, loved Atomic Blonde (2017) Theron was awesome!. if you liked that I definitely recommend both Lucy (2014) and Red Sparrow (2018)
1,but if you like newer there's stuff like Atomic Blonde (2017) or maybe The Expendables (2010). Recently saw Brick Mansions (2014) it was okay, but not much to talk about really.
1,There's no violence, it's more heart warming in nature.. If you like something funnier, what about Air Bud: World Pup (2000)
0,It's a real tear-jerker, especially if you have dogs.. What about A Dog's Purpose (2017)
1,I actually haven't seen it, but I heard good things.. I know that The Greatest Showman (2017) had some musical numbers
1,The Greatest Showman (2017) was gorgeous. My personal fave is Moulin Rouge! (2001)
1,just wondering if you could recomend some good musicals. Have you seen La La Land (2016) ?
1,like every time I watch either version. Chicago (2002) is also good if you want high production value
1,its a bit odd, but thats part of why I loved it so much. The Greatest Showman (2017) was gorgeous
1,What's your favorite?. I think I have to go with Rent (2005)
1,Have you seen La La Land (2016) ?. I loved La La Land (2016)
1,but you've probably already seen that... Just recently saw Blade Runner 2049 (2017) which a bit slow, but a beautiful film
1,Wow I loved The Matrix (1999) . I will check out Dark City (1998). I mean, as far as plot goes, The Matrix is waaay more an &quot;actiony&quot; film than Dark City (1998)
1,I liked the movie Sunshine (2007) personally, but others might find it hit or miss. Does Blade Runner 2049 (2017) have a good soundtrack?
1,Is it similar to Blade Runner (1982). Actually it's more similar to The Matrix (1999) even though it came out earlier than that film
1,Actually it's more similar to The Matrix (1999) even though it came out earlier than that film. Wow I loved The Matrix (1999) . I will check out Dark City (1998)

1,Hello I like movies like Tron (1982)
1,I have not.. Is it similar to Blade Runner (1982)

1,Just recently saw Blade Runner 2049 (2017) which a bit slow, but a beautiful film. I liked the movie Sunshine (2007) personally, but others might find it hit or miss
1,i haven't tactfully. I did see Blade Runner (1982)

1,Set in Australia and same vibe. what about The Matrix (1999)
1,It was good. Better visuals than the original Blade Runner (1982). you could also try Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)
0,right. you should try Idiocracy (2006)
1,agreed. It's campy but my favorite is The Fifth Element
1,I was looking for a parody. something like Airplane! (1980)
1,It is a Mel Brooks parody of Hitchcock films. Like Vertigo (1958)
1,Vertigo, great movie. I have heard of that.. I saw it a while ago after re-watching Spaceballs (1987)
1,something like Airplane! (1980). or Scary Movie (2000)

1,can you recommend anything else?. Absolutely, I also loved Space Jam (1996) , hopefully it isn't too dated!

1,I will have to check that one out!. how about Coneheads (1993)
1,comedy. I haven't watched Coneheads (1993) since I was a child! That one will be very nostalgic.
1,I have only seen parts of it, maybe I should watch it from the beginning?. or maybe Spies Like Us (1985)
1,Oh, I think I have heard of that.. I would think you would like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
1,Hmm like Dogma (1999) ?. not really more like the lines of Up in Smoke (1978)
1,But not Dogma, interesting.. What about something like Jury Duty (1995) ?

1,Do you know any good drama films like Silence (2016) or Darkest Hour (2017) ?. I sure do. I love the classics like the classics like The Godfather (1972) or American Beauty (1999) . Have you seen either?
1,I agree with that. I would say I like a bit of a mixture. One I do love it The Others (2001). I've never even heard of that one, but a mixture might actually be the new Halloween (2007) or it's sequel
1,scary movies seem to have changed. I agree with that. I would say I like a bit of a mixture. One I do love it The Others (2001)
1,What kind of movies are you looking for?. I really am looking for a good sports movie like The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)

1,You are right! It is a good one. I have never seen Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) , but have you ever seen Swiss Family Robinson (1960) ?
1,Any suggestions?. I love Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)
1,Oh I forgot about that one! I think that one is excellent!!. I also like Babes in Toyland (1934) and The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) . I know that are all old movies, but all so good. They don't make movies like they used to.
1,Futuristic fictions will do.. I have seen The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015) and really liked them.
1,Right. lol they had to know something! That's what I thought about The Hunger Games !. So i'm not sure if you're into gore type movies, but The Purge: Election Year (2016) is actually set in 2040 and The Purge: Anarchy (2014) is set in 2023
1,So i'm not sure if you're into gore type movies, but The Purge: Election Year (2016) is actually set in 2040 and The Purge: Anarchy (2014) is set in 2023. I enjoyed The Purge: Election Year (2016) more than the others. they are coming out with a new one this summer that is a prequel to all the Purge (2012) movies
1,Just depends on the story line and such. I will check them out.. And to throw in a light hearted movie WALL-E (2008) is a favorite of mine
1,I have seen The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015) and really liked them.. Oh the The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) is a great movie!!
1,Oh the The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) is a great movie!!. There is a youtube movie called The Thinning that I really enjoyed. It's about a new thing in the schools in Texas where if kids don't pass this exam, they &quot;die&quot; however they really don't, they just get sent underground. its to thin out the &quot;non-smart kids&quot;
1,Jarhead 3: The Siege. I just saw Pacific Rim it was good
1,I will check it out.. if you like movies like that Saving Private Ryan (1998)
1,Yes that was a good movie. did you see Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden
1,any suggestions. Die Hard 2 (1990)
1,I am interested in watching a hilarious movie today!. That's so funny! I just got finished watching The Hangover (2009) , which has to be one of the funniest movies.
1,those are some funny ones!. Are you an Adam Sandler fan? 'Cause he had some great movies I can suggest, like The Waterboy (1998) , which STILL cracks me up.
1,I love 50 First Dates (2004). oh I love The Hangover (2009) series too!
1,I love him in Big Daddy (1999). That was good. Oh, you should also see The Ridiculous 6 (2015) , it's a more recent movie of his on Netflix. Super funny.
1,That's so funny! I just got finished watching The Hangover (2009) , which has to be one of the funniest movies.. I love 50 First Dates (2004)
1,I am yes! I have not seen that one though. I will have to look it up. I love him in Big Daddy (1999)
1,I am on the search for a fun children's movie for my three girls. Have you seen The Spy Next Door (2010) ?
1,I have seen that one. Do you know of any like it?. It is very similar to Home Alone (1990) .
1,They really like Moana (2016). Inside Out (2015) I have a feeling they may not have seen that one!
1,My kids love that! I was hoping for something a bit more recent though. Okay! how about Inside Out (2015) ?
1,Okay! how about Inside Out (2015) ?. They really like Moana (2016)
1,Inside Out (2015) I have a feeling they may not have seen that one!. Or maybe even Tangled (2010) or Frozen (2013) ?
1,Okay. Do you know any movies with Wanda Sykes in them?. I loved Evan Almighty (2007) and Monster-in-Law (2005) .
1,I loved Evan Almighty (2007) and Monster-in-Law (2005) .. I suppose i could recommend Evan Almighty (2007) or even Snatched (2017) with whats her face
1,I liked that one.. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) is very good i'm not a huge fan of Rom Coms but i really enjoyed it!
1,Romantic comedies.. I did like Not Another Happy Ending (2013) . Loved it!
1,No! Are they good?. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) is also good it's staring Heath Ledger and Karen Maccullah
1,I don't mind.. If you like animation Rio (2011) was a good one that would be child friendly if you're looking for a family movie
1,I did like Not Another Happy Ending (2013) . Loved it!. I liked Silver Linings Playbook (2012) too.
1,I liked Silver Linings Playbook (2012) too.. Have you ever seen Pretty Woman (1990) ? Or maybe even How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) with Matthew MacConahay?
1,Office Space (1999) was good too. haven't seen Tropic Thunder (2008)
1,Saw it. It was pretty silly. How about DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004) or Tropic Thunder (2008) ?
1,thought that was funny. Groundhog Day (1993) was good
1,Groundhog Day (1993) was good. Have you seen Zoolander (2001) ? I thought that one had a similar sense of humor as Anchorman
1,I will check it out.. If you liked Office Space, you might like Horrible Bosses (2011)
1,What kind of comedies do you like?. something like Anchorman
1,Liked that movie.. Office Space (1999) was good too
0,I did not get to see that one! I think that is a great suggestion. It Comes at Night (2017) was awful! Nothing actually ever came. LOL
0,It Comes at Night (2017) was awful! Nothing actually ever came. LOL. I haven't seen Mother! (2017) , I have heard it is okay.

1,I also saw Red Sparrow (2018) recently. Not a good movie at all.... What about Annabelle: Creation (2017) ? That was really good.
0,Like Inception (2010). I also saw Red Sparrow (2018) recently. Not a good movie at all...

1,Could you give me a few recommendaitons on new horror movies?. I have heard the the new It (2017) is really good. Have you seen it?

0,What about Annabelle: Creation (2017) ? That was really good.. Or It Comes at Night (2017) , that was really creepy.
1,I haven't seen those. We loved Neighbors (2014) and I think they are pretty similar.. I think so too but I haven't seen Neighbors (2014) so I'm not certain.
1,I haven't seen that, I will have to look into it!. Grown Ups (2010) and Grown Ups 2 (2013) were both funny.
1,Sure, we are pretty open to anything.. We really loved Super Troopers (2001) and we can't wait for Super Troopers 2 (2018) to come out.
1,Neither can I!. Monster-in-Law (2005) is a good rom com.
1,Grown Ups (2010) and Grown Ups 2 (2013) were both funny.. I haven't seen those. We loved Neighbors (2014) and I think they are pretty similar.
1,I saw The Conjuring (2013) and loved it.. Have you seen The Conjuring 2 (2016) ?

1,I would love to help you with that. Can you tell me some movies you enjoy, so I can narrow down my search?. I really liked Titanic (1997) and Stepmom (1998)
1,Are they silly humor or more raunchy?. Another one is Game Night (2018)
1,Another one is Game Night (2018). Step Brothers (2008) is silly. Hangover (2010) is raunchy.

1,Usually sequels aren't very good in my opinion but 22 Jump Street was actually pretty funny for my tastes. Oh, I've seen 22 Jump Street (2014) especially loved the credits scene where they're doing the &quot;sequels&quot;!
1,The second one was also pretty funny. You mean, We're the Millers (2013) ?
1,Meet the Millers was a classic too if you aren't turned off by that style. I've seen the first and The Hangover Part III (2013) I liked them
1,Hello! What types of movies interest you most?. I really like Shaun of the Dead (2004)
0,I have really enjoyed 21 Jump Street and the sequel 22 Jump Street. But I didn't really care for the latests wave of &quot;parody&quot; films like Meet the Spartans (2008)
1,I really like Shaun of the Dead (2004). And I also liked The Other Guys (2010)
1,Cool! I'll have to check it out!. Oh wow! So Horrible Bosses (2011) is a definite and apparently there is a sequel to it as well Horrible Bosses 2 (2014) but I can't comment on it
1,Well, hopefully I gave ya some good ones to start out with! :). I have seen National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) many years ago. It is very funny. Can't beat classic comedy!
1,which, actually, I haven't seen believe it or not.. been meaning to, but I happened to catch 22 Jump Street (2014) during a free Cinemax weekend! :). I have actually seen 22 Jump Street (2014) et, I thought it was equally as good and would love to see more sequels.
0,Yes, I agree! Tropic Thunder (2008) was definitely a unique movie but very funny!. Whatever you do though, avoid Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015) Uhhhh...
1,I have actually seen 22 Jump Street (2014) et, I thought it was equally as good and would love to see more sequels.. I also recommend the film Tropic Thunder (2008) it was pretty funny

1,Have not seen that one. Yes I agree! Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009) was pretty good but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015) was certainly a let down
1,I'm interested in comedies. I really enjoyed 21 Jump Street (2012). Well, then you gotta see the sequel, 22 Jump Street (2014) I'm told it's funnier than the original.
1,Well, then you gotta see the sequel, 22 Jump Street (2014) I'm told it's funnier than the original.. which, actually, I haven't seen believe it or not.. been meaning to, but I happened to catch 22 Jump Street (2014) during a free Cinemax weekend! :)

Will Ferrell is usually hit or miss but Mark Wahlberg has been in some good movies for sure.
0,Yes I agree! Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009) was pretty good but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015) was certainly a let down. You should avoid The Campaign (2012) . I am usually a fan of Zack Galifianakis but this one wasn't too good in my opinion.

1,You should avoid The Campaign (2012) . I am usually a fan of Zack Galifianakis but this one wasn't too good in my opinion.. Vacation (2015) wasn't too bad, it's like a &quot;soft reboot&quot; of National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)
1,And the movie The Other Guys (2010) was good too. Yes, I agree! Tropic Thunder (2008) was definitely a unique movie but very funny!
0,Whatever you do though, avoid Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015) Uhhhh.... I didn't particularly care for The Campaign (2012) , have you seen it?
