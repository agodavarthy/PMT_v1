1,True enough! Tell me one more of your favorites. I saw A Quiet Place (2018) last month and was really impressed.
1,I don't really enjoy war movies. I much prefer horror. My favorites are The Shining (1980) , The Witch (2015) and Resolution (2012). Have you seen The Shape of Water (2017)

0,Hello. Hi! What's your pleasure? War? Black Hawk Down (2002) is a favorite of mine

1,Oh, that's a good one.. I also like Mission: Impossible

1,I also like Mission: Impossible. How about Gone Girl (2014) ? We loved that one.
0,Those are great suggestions. I appreciate them!. A more recent one is Get Out (2017) It's not a ghost story but has a bit of a horror vibe
1,Well have fun binging!. I'm going to look up Sleepy Hollow High (2000) for sure. Thank you!
1,Something like, well, Ghost Story (1981) , for example.. Ha ha. There's Sleepy Hollow High (2000)
0,A more recent one is Get Out (2017) It's not a ghost story but has a bit of a horror vibe. I liked Get Out (2017) , but it hasn't been that long since we watched it. Good suggestion otherwise.
1,I'll have to look it up. Is it scary or funny?. A little of both. Did you see The Blair Witch Project (1999)
1,But, not silly like Ghostbusters (1984) . Like it, not in the mood for it.. Oh, I've not seen Sleepy Hollow High (2000) .
0,Ha ha. There's Sleepy Hollow High (2000). But, not silly like Ghostbusters (1984) . Like it, not in the mood for it.
1,Good afternoon! I'm in the mood to sit in the cool air conditioning and watch a good ghost story.. Something like, well, Ghost Story (1981) , for example.
1,Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it !. I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010)
1,Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store !. To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of Inception (2010) , Paprika (2006) by Satoshi Kon. It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip.
1,If you want to suggest something not from the 80's, that's okay, too. If you can think of something similar to that era, it's good.. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is super good !
1,What kind of movies do you like. I'm great, thanks for asking! I'm in the mood for a great 80's horror film. My favorite horror film of all time is probably The Lost Boys (1987) .
1,Yes! We loved that movie. It was scary back then, campy now.. I've seen that recently. Can you think of another? We also loved Child's Play (1988) .
1,Hahha exactly ! Still gives me shivers lol. Have you seen The Fly (1986) ?!
1,Okay great !. I love comedies ! Have you seen Wise Guys (1986)

1,How are you ?. I'm good, and I Hope you are as well! I'm in the mood for a silly comedy. Something along the lines of Weekend at Bernie's (1989) , perhaps?
1,That has Danny Devito in it, I think?. Yesss awesome movie !!!! I also enjoyed Fun with Dick and Jane (2005)
1,We love crazy movies. Police Academy (1984) is another one we like but we saw that recently.. I forgot about Wise Guys (1986) . I seem to remember liking it.

1,Yes, I did. Thank you!. Rush Hour (1998) ?
1,Oh, yeah. Mostly in the 1970s and 1980s.. She was hilarious in Private Benjamin (1980) .
1,I've seen Bad Moms and The Nutty Professor, but not Rush Hour. I'll check it out.. Have you seen the new Overboard (2018) ? I saw the old Overboard (1987) , and I was just wondering if the new one was any good?

1,What about Misery (1990) ? I think that's the right one.. Misery (1990) I read the book and it was GRIM!
1,I think all my suggestions are at most PG13. What about Misery (1990) ? I think that's the right one.
1,I'm looking for a movie to make my boyfriend uncomfortable.. Oh then you gotta get The Other Woman (2014) It will have him squirming
1,Hello. What's up?. Hi tell me what kind of movies you like. I saw The Shape of Water (2017) it was great
1,There's An Officer and a Gentleman if he's being a heel.. Haha. Sounds good. Is The Other Woman (2014) the grown up version of John Tucker Must Die (2006)
1,Sounds so familiar, but I don’t think i got the chance to go see it ! Lol. I'm sure you've seen Half Baked (1998) , right?
1,Hi. Having a good weekend?. Great so far. I need something unusual to watch that will hold my attention. I liked Never Let Me Go (2010)
1,Hope you enjoy them. Have a great night. Haven't seen Rachel Getting Married (2008) but on the list it goes. I like robot films too, like I, Robot (2004)
1,Thank You for Smoking (2005) is a dark comedy. And Rachel Getting Married (2008) Ann Hathaway is an alcoholic and wreaks havoc at her sister's wedding
1,Never heard of that but The Shape of Water (2017) was kind of other worldly. Thank You for Smoking (2005) is a dark comedy
1,Great so far. I need something unusual to watch that will hold my attention. I liked Never Let Me Go (2010). Never heard of that but The Shape of Water (2017) was kind of other worldly

0,No. Haven't heard of it. Who's in it?. Or Oliver! (1968)
0,Or Oliver! (1968). You know I like the stage version of Oliver! (1968) better.
1,*uncomfortable. lol i see. How about Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) ? Have you watched it? I think he might be pretty uncomfortable
1,That's funny.. I agree with you Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) is defiantly not worth watching again
1,It's not the best movie, but it was okay.. I actually liked Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) . I watched Fifty Shades Darker (2017) with my husband and he was uncomfortable.
1,Google says that Gone Girl (2014) might be uncomfortable to watch together. Bit I don;t know why. I loved Gone Girl (2014). Gone Girl (2014) is exactly about the revenge! Maybe you should go with this one
1,If you're in the mood for revenge, Shakespeare style.. Google says that Gone Girl (2014) might be uncomfortable to watch together. Bit I don;t know why. I loved Gone Girl (2014)
1,Maybe because she fakes her own death, right?. Is there a bit of mystery or suspense in Gone Girl (2014) ?
1,Yes by I can't say it's uncomfortable. Not to me I Guess ). There is for sure a lot of mystery in Gone Girl (2014)
1,There is for sure a lot of mystery in Gone Girl (2014). Alright I like that idea. I'm going with Gone Girl (2014) !
1,In other hands Borat (2006) was making me more uncomfortable, not my husband. Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) is basically a movie for girls. He didn't like it and he said it was dumb . lol
1,There's also Singin' in the Rain (1952) with Gene Kelly. Yes, I like the old ones. South Pacific was great. So was Singing in the Rain. Of course, my all-time favorite is The Sound of Music (1965) .

1,looking for something funny. How did you like Ghostbusters (2016) ?

1,that's the new one right?. Yeah. If you want to watch the original series, you should, but for a quick over view, watch Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth
1,I did. :). I'm a huge fan of the franchise. Ghost in the Shell: Arise is also good. It's the latest installment in the franchise.
1,Hi! Can you recommend some good anime?. Sure. Ghost in the Shell (1995)
1,Did you? Cool.. You should also checkout Evangelion: 2.0 You Can Advance . Not like ghost, but it's a good political drama
1,sweet! lol. Since you've seen Ninja Scroll (1993) what about Princess Mononoke (1997) ?
1,I've seen it. But I didn't much care for it.. I prefer more of the hardcore stuff. Like Akira (1988)
1,Or Appleseed. What's Appleseed ?
1,I prefer more of the hardcore stuff. Like Akira (1988). Well Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2001) is what you want
0,sweet! lol. Since you've seen Ninja Scroll (1993) what about Princess Mononoke (1997) ?
1,Well Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2001) is what you want. Or Appleseed
1,It is. But it's an expansion of the story.. Also before I forget check out Inuyasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler
1,Also before I forget check out Inuyasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler. it's not as intense as Berserk The Golden Age Arc (2012) but similar in concept and themse

1,and welcome back!. There's also Vexille which is similar to Appleseed
0,What about Going in Style (2017) with Morgan FReeman?. I didn't love the new Ghostbusters (2016) though

1,Anime. No Cars 3 (2017) or pixar movies or nothing like that. You want a single film or multiple? If the latter I would suggest Ghost in the Shell (1995) and it's subsequent titles
1,You want a single film or multiple? If the latter I would suggest Ghost in the Shell (1995) and it's subsequent titles. Is that like Akira (1988) ?
0,Anime or animated movies? Kind of a difference there.. Anime. No Cars 3 (2017) or pixar movies or nothing like that
1,No, but it does discuss politics and societal norms like it. It's more of a philosophical/political drama. still really good. And the subsequent films Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society (2006) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence dive even deeper into those themes
1,What else. If you want more mystery, go with Mulholland Drive (2001) or Primal Fear (1996)
1,Either. I'm not choosy as long as it has a good story.. I have teo. Black Swan (2010) and Donnie Darko (2001) . A mix of old and new

1,Hello! I'm looking for a good movie to watch this morning. Can you help?. Sure thing! Might I suggest some early morning drama? The Family Stone (2005) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993) are two of my favorites.

1,And one last thing. How about a comdey?. Perhaps The Nutty Professor (1996) will suffice?
1,I love Don Cheadle. Do you know any more movies by him?. There are plenty, but I would recommend Brooklyn's Finest (2009) (with Welsey Snipes) and Traitor (2008) . It's like an action/espionage film.
1,Ok. I like Shemar. He was good on Criminal Minds.. There's also The Wood (1999) featuring Taye Diggs and Omar Epps. It's similar to The Brothers (2001)
1,Okay. Great. Another good one is Talk to Me (2007) . It's about Ralph &quot;Petey&quot; Greene, the radio talkshow host from the 60s. Don Cheadle is in that one.

1,Okay then. First up I have Wild Things (1998) with NEve Campbell.. The girl from Scream (1996)

1,I love the older DC movies.. I know! I love it. I also really liked Spider-Man (2002)

1,I really like supehero movies.. Ok, have you seen the original Superman (1978) with Christopher Reeve?
1,It is where the police detective has to hunt down the pentagram killer. It has Lou Diamond Phillips.. I loved him in La Bamba (1987)
1,I do like that! Odd couple movies.. But maybe Bad Boys II (2003) would be up your alley.
1,What would you see is the best film, in the same sort of genre?. Bad Boys II (2003)
1,I am looking to see some good films.. Have you seen Daredevil (2003) or Thirteen Ghosts (2001)
1,Both are good. They can be a little inappropriate, but very funny!. Have you ever watched Scary Movie (2000) ? It's more comedy than horror, I promise ;)

1,Yes.. The Searchers (1956) is a classic.
0,And hello, I am well.. Have you ever seen Blazing Saddles (1974)
1,no not a funny one ... I want a good old western. There is True Grit (1969)
1,Don't Breathe (2016) is good.. What about one like The Amityville Haunting (2011) ?
1,I like the first one.. I enjoyed Hangover (2014)
1,What sort of movies are you into?. Well, Big on the comedy aspect I reckon. I fancy the intense over the top flicks like The Hangover (2009) and Project X (2012)
1,I do not know what that means.. Oh, maybe Juno (2007)
1,Haha, Ive actually never seen Elf (2003) . Loved Superbad (2007) bit overplayed now for me at this point though.. Or even Mr. Mom (1983) if you are into the 80's
1,It has the girl from Elf (2003) right?. If you like that one, I would go for something like Superbad (2007)
1,Ahh, maybe 21 Jump Street (2012) ?. Both good flicks there. Thanks. Havent seen Mr. Mom (1983) in ages ill have to check that flick out again soon. heh
1,Do you know any like that one?. That was an alright flick I reckon. Umm maybe 500 Days of Summer sort of reminds me of it there.
1,Or even Mr. Mom (1983) if you are into the 80's. Ahh, maybe 21 Jump Street (2012) ?
1,If you like that one, I would go for something like Superbad (2007). Haha, Ive actually never seen Elf (2003) . Loved Superbad (2007) bit overplayed now for me at this point though.
1,I sure could!. have you ever saw Superbad (2007) ?
1,Same here!. Maybe something like Juno (2007) ? A little dark, but funny!
1,I love the first. Have never heard of the second one.. Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) is a great mix of genres if you dont mind musical sequences
1,Well, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) for comedy.. The Princess Bride (1987) for over all best film ever made.

1,Yes, I saw Poltergeist (1982) -- it was good, they came out with a remake in Poltergeist (2015) .. I remember that. They did a good job with the remake I think. You might want to watch The Conjuring 2 (2016) if you haven't seen it yet. It is a legit scary horror movie

1,Oldman was great in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns .. the A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) suggestions aren't in that caliber but you can past the time

1,indeed it does. Black Swan (2010) has a great story line, and amazing visuals

1,Good morning. What type of movie are you considering?. If you like Drama, American Beauty (1999) is a good one.
1,i saw that back when netflix was new. What about Crash (2004) ?

1,You like comedy movies?. hard to choose between comedies like Neighbors (2014)
1,Cool, have you watched Bruce Almighty (2003) ?. or dramas like Black Swan (2010)
1,I think I have. no wait I've seen Dogma (1999)
1,hard to choose between comedies like Neighbors (2014). Cool, have you watched Bruce Almighty (2003) ?
1,Yes, I've seen that. The Wolverine (2013) was something my Marvel junkies liked too I think. I don't know much I am getting help from the junkies
1,I can see something non Marvel if that's easier for you. Black Panther (2018) I hear is really good
1,That's funny.. As much as I like Norton's work Hulk (2003) just did not do it for me

1,Have you seen X-Men (2000) ? It's along those lines. X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) was interesting

1,They are fun though! And apparently I have been over ruled. It was my plan to go see A Wrinkle in Time today. but it's two to one Blacktop (2000). I think it was more the movie itself not Edward. Mark fills the role well in The Incredible Hulk (2008) &amp; The Avengers (2012)
1,I think it was more the movie itself not Edward. Mark fills the role well in The Incredible Hulk (2008) &amp; The Avengers (2012). err Black Panther (2018) I mean
1,Black Panther (2018) I hear is really good. Have you seen X-Men (2000) ? It's along those lines

There weren't any fancy effects, and it was simple, but that's why I liked it. It really stood out among the current movies that all have CGI or overdone plots.
1,I hope I suggested some things you can watch.. I recently watched Larry Crowne (2011) which is kind of like that. Just simple but a good story.

1,The director is one of the best there is, Wes Anderson, also the director of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) and Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) .. I would like a comedy something like The Love Guru (2008)
1,Do you want more movie recommendations?. sure any for a horror movie my favorite is The Stranger (2010)
1,sure any for a horror movie my favorite is The Stranger (2010). I liked It (2017) , have you watched it?
1,The Dictator (2012) is similar to that movie. I think.. I have seen The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) its so good!
0,I never saw that one either, but I know it has some of the same actors. Pineapple Express (2008) too is good in my honest opinion.
1,I just watched Hot Fuzz (2007) and liked it. Definitely, What We Do in the Shadows (2014) is the best!
1,Do you have any comedies you could recommend?. I just watched Hot Fuzz (2007) and liked it
1,Thanks for the suggestions!. Due Date too! Robert Downey and Zach Galifianakis.
1,Sure.. Shaun of the Dead (2004) was funnier for me than Hot Fuzz (2007)
1,Funny and entertaining. or maybe Lone Survivor (2013)
1,I started it, it wasn't really funny in my opinion. I did just see John Wick (2014) which I thought was pretty good
1,Bye!. hmm what about Black Hawk Down (2002)
1,I did just see John Wick (2014) which I thought was pretty good. Oh then you may Enjoy Red (2010)
1,hmm what about Black Hawk Down (2002). Black Hawk Down (2002) was great, I loved the intensity in it
0,I am doing well. Have you seen Pineapple Express (2008)
1,yes it is. I have seen Lone Survivor (2013) , it was good and I'm actually reading the book now.
1,What about Pineapple Express (2008) ?. i also enjoyed Pineapple Express (2008)
1,A lot of people really liked it!. Have you seen The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005) ?
1,of my favorites. oh i loved 21 Jump Street (2012) and 22 Jump Street (2014)
1,Both great, the first was better in my opinion. What about Pineapple Express (2008) ?
1,good to hear that. Have you seen 21 Jump Street (2012) ?
1,I'm doing pretty well! Have you seen any good movies lately?. do you know any movie like Halloween (1978)
1,and i love Space Jam (1996). there was a great thing about The Notebook (2004)
1,yes those are very great. Yes, I really loved The Notebook (2004) . Those are some really great suggestions! Thanks
1,there was a great thing about The Notebook (2004). and Dear John (2010)
1,do you know any movie like Halloween (1978). and i love Space Jam (1996)
1,and Dear John (2010). A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is a favorite of mine, as is Scream (1996) if you're in the mood for lighter movies
1,I can also say that the best sci fi horror movie that came out of the 80's was The Terminator (1984). Predator (1987) , The Terminator (1984) , and Aliens (1986) were the best the 80s produced! Outside of the slew of ski movies I like as a guilty pleasure.
1,Truly! Ghostbusters (1984) was a thousand times better than Ghostbusters (2016). many times it works very VERY well, like with Star Wars (1977)
1,I know a terrible one if you want a good laugh.. Dracula 3000 (2004) is so bad, it is funny.
0,many times it works very VERY well, like with Star Wars (1977). Have you seen the latest Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) ? I haven't gotten around to it yet.
1,Creature (1985) was a decent so bad it's good movie that was actually a response to Alien (1979). I didn't know that. How about Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988) for a one off night joke movie.
1,The television series The Expanse is currently where I fill that gap in my life. Though that isn't a movie.. Creature (1985) was a decent so bad it's good movie that was actually a response to Alien (1979)
1,Predator (1987) , The Terminator (1984) , and Aliens (1986) were the best the 80s produced! Outside of the slew of ski movies I like as a guilty pleasure.. I haven't. and I do not plan to. I prefer the original trilogy. I can watch those over and over and not get bored. The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is definitely the best sci fi film ever made
1,I used to pretend the headlights of cars were clown noses and shoot them with my cousin in the backseat. Memories!. Galaxy of Terror (1981) was also great
0,I like movies that are well made, but I also can appreciate when the film makers did their best with the budget they were given. Truly! Ghostbusters (1984) was a thousand times better than Ghostbusters (2016)
1,Have you seen the latest Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) ? I haven't gotten around to it yet.. I can also say that the best sci fi horror movie that came out of the 80's was The Terminator (1984)
1,I like movies that are well made, but I also can appreciate when the film makers did their best with the budget they were given. Truly! Ghostbusters (1984) was a thousand times better than Ghostbusters (2016)
1,Dracula 3000 (2004) is so bad, it is funny.. know of any that are like Alien (1979) ?
1,Can I suggest a movie to end it right?. I'm looking to see a good action movie like True Lies (1994) or Fortress (1992)
1,Yeah that is a good one I love it!. Something similar as well would be Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)
1,Do you have any other suggestions?. You could watch The Italian Job (2003) .
1,I like those!. I love True Lies. What about something like National Treasure (2004) ?
1,Wow never heard of that either. Sounds good too.. Then of course there are classics like It (1990) or the new It (2017) , but I'm sure you've seen them!
1,I've never heard of it. Sounds interesting.. Strange Circus (2005) might also be of interest, it's been described as a horror movie &quot;turned up to 11.&quot; I think it's Japanese, but it's themes are very adult.
1,Sure. A horror please. Past or present is fine.. What a good genre. Have you seen The Burning (1981) ? It's a bit of a cult-classic.
1,Maybe a good action movie like The Expendables (2010). Well there are the sequels The Expendables 2 (2012) and The Expendables 3 (2014)
1,Are there any other kinds of movies you like to watch?. Maybe a good action movie like The Expendables (2010)
1,Hello! What kind of movies do you like?. I would like to see a good ninja movie like Enter the Dragon (1973) or Rumble in the Bronx (1995)
1,Do you have any good suggestions?. Those are really good! Fist of Fury is pretty good in my opinion
1,Thanks!. But if you're looking for a different universe you could try The Specialist (1994) !
0,Love, love, love that movie and him.. Same! Paranormal Activity (2007) freaked me out, but only the first one in the series.
1,I just thought about that. I really liked it.. And if you like Rob Zombie movies, you can watch House of 1000 Corpses (2003) or The Devil's Rejects (2005)
1,Horror movies please. Past or present is fine.. One of my favorite older horror movies is Misery (1990) . It's based on a Stephen King novel.
1,I am too scared of that stuff to see it.. Got it. Maybe Panic Room (2002) ? It's not that gory.
1,Alternatively, can't go wrong with the Predator (1987) or Alien (1979) series.. Oh yeah, I actually am not sure I've seen the entire The Bourne Identity (2002) movie. I'll have to watch it. I love those other movies.
1,I really liked him in Taken (2008). Did you know that John Wick (2014) is actually a video game movie? It is based on the Payday game series.
1,Sure! I suppose my go-to action movie right now would have to be The Bourne Identity (2002) . Not very inspired, I know. But solid film.. Alternatively, can't go wrong with the Predator (1987) or Alien (1979) series.
1,Oh yeah, I actually am not sure I've seen the entire The Bourne Identity (2002) movie. I'll have to watch it. I love those other movies.. I'll make time to watch The Bourne Identity (2002) . Thanks for the suggestions!

1,I'll make time to watch The Bourne Identity (2002) . Thanks for the suggestions!. Ip Man if you are just looking for fighting.
1,Like John Wick (2014). Action movies are always good. Can't beat a classic like Die Hard (1988)
1,I'm looking for some good action movies.. Like John Wick (2014)
1,Oh yeah, Die Hard (1988) is great. I like Liam Neison also.. I really liked him in Taken (2008)
1,Interesting! Do you have any other action movie suggestions for me?. Sure! I suppose my go-to action movie right now would have to be The Bourne Identity (2002) . Not very inspired, I know. But solid film.
1,I am not sure if I would call that one an adventure comedy. Though it was a good movie.. Back to the Future (1985)
0,I remember seeing that one in theaters. It was a great movie.. Conspiracy Theory (1997)
1,Hi there! I was wondering if you have any adventure comedies you could recommend. Something like Maverick (1994) for example.. I would recommend Space Cowboys (2000)
1,Hi there! I was wondering if you have any adventure comedies you could recommend. Something like Maverick (1994) for example.
1,I have! it is adorable. If you liked that movie, I would suggest Rent (2005) . It isn't a child's movie but the songs are just as catchy.. I also enjoyed Brave (2012)

1,Can't wait for the second one this summer. Have you seen Pitch Perfect (2012) ? It's great
1,Thanks for the help and being able to chat without judgment is so nice. Well they may laugh at you for many singing movies. But Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) is dark enough they may dig it.
