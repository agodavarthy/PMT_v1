1,I liked that sort of action movie with some humor, I think that's why I liked Ant-Man (2015) as well. I haven't seen Ant-Man (2015) . That marvel movie probably can't be as funny as Deadpool (2016) , since it is tied to the MCU.

1,Sure!. As a matter of fact, I watched Murder on the Orient Express (2017) just last night with my son. We loved it.
1,It is. But it's still an okay movie.. If that sounds too slow, try Life (2017) with Jake Gylenhal and Ryan Reynolds. It's a dark film about an alien life form from Mars.
0,Good point. :). What about Passengers (2016) with Jennifer Laawrence and Chris Pratt?
1,Yeah, that's more my speed. :). In that case, also try The Thing (2011) . It's not a remake of the original, it's a prequel. It tells the story of what happened to the Norwegians before the dog shows up at the US camp

1,cool, did you like them?. what about Big Fish (2003) that is more fantasy I guess
1,Why Him%3F (2016) with James Franco, Bryan Cranston, and Zoey Deutch is a good funny movie. It kind of runs in the same crowd as Superbad (2007) and Knocked Up (2007)

1,Hi, I need a good recommendation for a thriller. Perfect have you seen Double Jeopardy (1999) with Ashley Judd? That is a great thriller
1,give me something else from the 90s. She is also in two amazing thrillers with Morgan Freeman caled Kiss the Girls (1997) and High Crimes (2002)
1,I haven't seen her in anything else but those two movies and the tv show. But she was amazing in parenthod. Speed (1994) i liked that movie too, a lot of suspense
1,really that would be interesting. I&quot;ve heard mixed reviews about Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) though
1,I like sci-fi's, what do you recommend?. hey this is different, uhm, sci fi my favorite in the last 20 years is The Matrix (1999) I loved the fight scenes and FX
1,I haven't seen it yet but I want to watch it. I also wan to watch Blade Runner 2049 (2017)
1,saw that on yesterday. having mixed feelings. Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was pretty good. The tone switch from super serious Norse to comedy thru me for a bit though
1,thanks for that some great suggestions there. on Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) would you compare it more to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) where it was in the same universie but didn'nt feel the same or more like the other Star Wars movies. Same here on Blade Runner (1982) although I kinda wish they didn't include Harrison Ford since the original kinda left it open if he was a replicant or not.
0,That one is a classic comedy. Girls Trip (2017) is another funny comedy with great reviews

1,If you don't mind Rated-R films, Deadpool (2016) was fun. It was juvenile in the sense that it felt like it was written and acted by middle schoolers high on Pixie Stiks, but it was actually a lot of fun to see.. Oh yeah, I actually just saw Deadpool (2016) . My husband insisted. It was actually really funny and I'm looking forward to the next one.

1,I haven't seen it, but heard Bad Moms (2016) as well as A Bad Moms Christmas (2017) were really funny.. No. I am getting some good suggestions today. I need to expand my movies horizons so I'll look at that one too. Most of my comedies feature Adam Sandler like The Waterboy (1998)
1,Hello. Are you interested in suggestions in general or a specific genre?. Do you have suggestions for a good comedy like Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)

1,Have you seen it?. Not yet! People say mix things about it! Have you seen The Dark Knight (2008) ? It's my fave superhero movie

1,It's a sad movie. Inglourious Basterds (2009) I watched that lst night.. I saw part of it. I need to finish watching that movie but it was difficult to watch. I watched Hidden Figures (2016) recently. It was more uplifting, if not as realistic.
1,It's going well.. Yes, I have. Have you seen The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) ?
1,That's the one. It was good but I doubt that is really how the story went. I've heard good things about Inglourious Basterds (2009) . It reminds me a bit of Legends of the Fall (1994)

1,Hello, what kind of movies are you looking for?. I am looking for some Horror movies to watch. I really enjoyed It (2017) The Babadook (2014) and Get Out (2017)
1,Ah, yes I have, not too long ago. I loved that movie!. Nice. How about The Hallow (2015) ?
1,Sure, no problem.. Promised Land (2012) is good. It reminded me a lot of Good Will Hunting and stars Matt Damon.
1,Cool, I haven't seen that one! I like Matt Damon, so I'll definitely look for that.. Also A Beautiful Mind (2001) was really good if you don't mind it being a little bit of an older movie.
1,Oh absolutely. I'll ask you like I asked her. Can you give me maybe 2 movies you have really liked?. Something like Good Will Hunting (1997) or maybe like Australia (2008) .

1,I think something like Cinderella (2015) or The Princess Diaries (2001) would be just the thing. Well, if you like princess movies, there is Ella Enchanted (2004) .
1,I can't think of what that was. Maybe I did not see it. The movie I was actually thinking of dealing with numbers and aliens is something with Nicholas Cage but I can't think of the title of it either.. Now I got it. It was Knowing (2009) . Great movie but I'll never watch it again. It was too heart wrenching.
1,I hope some of these suggestions helped you out.. Yes, I remember Knowing (2009) : it was suprisingly deep for a Nic Cage movie.
1,The two that immediately come to mind are Hidden Figures (2016) and A Beautiful Mind (2001). Good Will Hunting (1997) is another one I've just thought of. I really liked that movie.
1,I watched most of it and was interrupted. I enjoyed the movie though and I will watch it again.. I recently watched The Hateful Eight (2015) which is Tarentino, I believe. That was a great movie.
1,I normally watch movies in the fantasy or science fiction genres but I'm trying to expand my interests. Do you know of any good movies that could be thought of as drama or thrillers?. I like watching thrillers. Have you seen Seven (1995) ?
1,No. I've always meant to watch it then forgot about it again. I'm actually going to watch it this time. Thank you.. Some people might think it's a bit scary. Have you watched this thriller called Get Out (2017) ?
1,I have not watched that one yet, but I really like Tarantino movies.. Have you watched Django Unchained (2012) ? It's by the same director.
1,Sure. One that I really like is About Time (2013) . It has time travel and romance, and is just really lovely.. Not sure if you like this kind of movie, but I was really touched by Under the Tuscan Sun (2003) . I love how it's about wonderful things coming from what seems like a really bad situation.
1,I'm hoping to find something interesting to watch. Can you think of any movies that you felt really made a connection for you?. Sure. One that I really like is About Time (2013) . It has time travel and romance, and is just really lovely.
1,If you enjoyed that one I will probably really like your other suggestions.. A couple more to consider are P.S. I Love You (2007) and Catch and Release (2006) . Both about making a new life after a loved one dies.
1,I will definitely check both of those out.. Another favorite of mine is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) . I love how it explores the idea of what would happen if you chose to forget someone you had been close to.
1,A couple more to consider are P.S. I Love You (2007) and Catch and Release (2006) . Both about making a new life after a loved one dies.. I have watched P.S. I Love You (2007) . Very good, although I cried. Every time I hear Flogging Molly I think of that movie.

1,Do you think you can help me?. Well the original Cloverfield was good, have you seen it?

0,which Star Wars (1977) is your favorite?. That's a really good one. Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) such compelling films.
1,I don't particularly like the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) are especially bad.. what are your thpughts on Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)
1,I love scifi too. which Star Wars (1977) is your favorite?
1,which Star Wars (1977) is your favorite?. That's a really good one. Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) such compelling films.
1,Sorry, machete order?. so you do Star Wars (1977) then The Empire Strikes Back (1980) , Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) and end with Return of the Jedi (1983)
1,what are your thpughts on Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). or Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)
1,its also just a fun way to kill a weekend if you don't have other plans. Hmmm I wonder how Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) would work as a flashback... after Star Wars (1977) the original?
1,She honestly is in incredible through the whole thing. The original Star Wars (1977) is my favorite by far, but The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) are wonderful too.
1,what kind of movies are you interested in?. What is your favorite movie of all time? Mine is Star Wars (1977)
1,it shifts the perspective in some fun ways. Interesting, I may have to do that. I have al of the Star Wars films on iTunes.
1,I love Science Fiction movies.. Thus us a hard question for me, but I think Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) is my top.
1,the prequels are slightly less painful if you watch in machete order I think. Now the stand alone Star Wars movies look very promising. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was excellent, and I have high hopes for the upcoming Han Solo movie.
1,Hmmm I wonder how Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) would work as a flashback... after Star Wars (1977) the original?. I'm not sure if they have worked in the new films yet but theres lots of discussion if you just google Star Wars (1977) and machete order
0,The original Star Wars (1977) is my favorite by far, but The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) are wonderful too.. I don't particularly like the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) and Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) are especially bad.
0,Sorry, machete order?. so you do Star Wars (1977) then The Empire Strikes Back (1980) , Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) and end with Return of the Jedi (1983)
1,Yes please! I like scary movies! DO you have any recommendations?. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) made it so I haven't been able to sleep in 20 years.
