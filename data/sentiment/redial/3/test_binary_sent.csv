1,I know this will sound crazy, but my AC went out today and it's hot. I want to watch a movie with SNOW.. Totally understand that. The Thing (1982) comes to mind
1,Something like Elf (2003) ?. Jingle All the Way (1996) is pretty wonderful for that genre!
1,Jingle All the Way (1996) is pretty wonderful for that genre!. I love National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) and my son is always up for that.
1,maybe even National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989). Something like Elf (2003) ?
1,I haven't seen Jingle All the Way (1996) . I'll look it up!. Snow Day (2000) is a fun one for kids
1,Maybe even a Christmas movie?. maybe even National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)
1,Totally understand that. The Thing (1982) comes to mind. The Thing (2011) is good too
1,I love National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) and my son is always up for that.. I haven't seen Jingle All the Way (1996) . I'll look it up!
1,I think I will look up Caddyshack (1980) and Camp Nowhere (1994) and see if I can interest him. Thanks for the ideas!. He might also like Treehouse Hostage (1999) .
1,Hello!. Hello! My son just went on summer break and I'm thinking of watching some summer themed movies. Something similar to Meatballs (1979) . Can you think of anything?
1,Caddyshack (1980) is another good movie!. I've been thinking of Ernest Goes to Camp (1987) , too.
1,It doesn't have to be a comedy, but we like comedys.. Have you seen Camp Nowhere (1994) ? He might like that.
1,I've been thinking of Ernest Goes to Camp (1987) , too.. Oh, Caddyshack (1980) . I hadn't thought of that one. Great suggestion.

1,Hello! I'm good. Do you know of any movies similar to Mean Girls (2004) that I might like?. I'm not so much into teenage movies unless they are smart. Like, Election (2005) , for example.
1,I'm not so much into teenage movies unless they are smart. Like, Election (2005) , for example.. That's a good movie. You might want to check out Easy A (2010) . It's a very good movie.
1,Oh, it has Emma Stone. I would love that.. There is another one that comes to mind that is worth watching Thirteen (2003) .
1,Hello How are you?. Hello! I'm good. Do you know of any movies similar to Mean Girls (2004) that I might like?
1,No I have never seen that one.. I'll look up Thirteen (2003) , also.
1,It seems to be a realistic portrayal of how rough growing up can sometimes be.. Another one I liked was Saved! (2004) . It was funny. Did you see that?
1,As am I.. I love Scream (1996) . It was well-written and even the sequels are decent.
1,I like the Annabelle (2014) movie. I haven't seen the 2nd one yet.. I'm not sure if I have or not. That sounds like The Sixth Sense (1999) once you've seen it the twist is gone.
1,I love Scream (1996) . It was well-written and even the sequels are decent.. Yes Scream (1996) will always be a favorite of mine.
1,The twist makes that movie and once you know it, it can't be unknown.. I like the Annabelle (2014) movie. I haven't seen the 2nd one yet.
1,Yes Scream (1996) will always be a favorite of mine.. One of the scariest movies without gore I've seen would be The Others (2001) . But, if you've seen it before, it would probably be ruined for a 2nd viewing.
1,I'm not sure if I have or not. That sounds like The Sixth Sense (1999) once you've seen it the twist is gone.. Annabelle (2014) is a good one for sure.
1,That is so sad. It's been years since I've watched that one.. I've been wanting to watch it again after I heard of her death. I think I liked Superman II (1980) even better, though.
1,I like everything. You have any good action super hero movies?. Sure! I really loved Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) , and the sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)
1,I love Batman.. My favorite superhero movie of all time is Superman (1978) . So sad that Margot Kidder died recently.
1,I haven't watched either of those yet.. The Dark Knight (2008) never disappoints either.
1,Well thank you.. Finally, I would suggest Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) . It's the last thing I saw in a movie theater of late and it's so good.
1,I have seen it, but it has been a very long time since I have watched it.. True Romance (1993) is great. I highly recommend that movie.
1,Actually, I Love You to Death (1990) is a comedy based on a true crime case. Kinda crazy.. Oh that sounds very interesting. That's like True Romance (1993) was based on an actual couple.
1,How about Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) ? That's a funny comedy with a warped kind of love interest.. I have to look up True Romance (1993) . It sounds interesting.
1,I've never even heard of it. I'm going to have to look it up.. Actually, I Love You to Death (1990) is a comedy based on a true crime case. Kinda crazy.
1,It is hilarious you will have to check it out.. If you like that type of movie, you might like I Love You to Death (1990) .

1,Good! I like dark comedies, like Fargo (1996) , do you have any recommendations?. Have you ever watched Dr. Strangelove (1964) ? For sure a classic.
1,Yes, I have and I enjoyed it. No fighting in the War Room!!. Or one that I always thought was a great movie American Psycho (2000) .
1,gets in your head.. I will always suggest Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) .
1,I re-watched The Karate Kid (1984) recently. Maybe Psycho (1960) is a good reference
1,These birds just seem to randomly start attacking people. I think there was some reason for it, but I don't remember that much. I just remember it was scary.. You would probably like something from Stephen King. I would recommend The Shining (1980) .
1,Okay! I'm glad I could help you!. i have seen The Shining (1980) its creepy
1,I know lots of movies. Any particular genre you are in the mood for? Horror? Comedy?. I re-watched The Karate Kid (1984) recently

0,Yes. I like the movies that keep you on the edge of your seat.. Have you heard of Get Out (2017) or Seven (1995)
1,Yes it is, a serial killer movie. I loved Get Out (2017) .
0,I've seen both of those, but I haven't seen Seven (1995) in years. Isn't that the one with the seven deadly sins as a theme?. Seven (1995) isn't my cup of tea. I'm usually not adverse to gore, but the scene where the man eats so much and busts his gut just did something to me. Haha!
0,Seven is a brad pitt classic. I've seen both of those, but I haven't seen Seven (1995) in years. Isn't that the one with the seven deadly sins as a theme?
1,I've seen The Avengers (2012) but I haven't seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017) .. The Avengers (2012) was great! Have you seen the sequels?

1,never opposed to good ol camp!. And The Green Mile (1999) makes me cry everytime
1,any suggestions to similar things?. The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
1,Hey. I really liked Escape from Alcatraz (1979)
1,The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Or maybe The Rock (1996) . Nicholas Cage is in that, so it's kind of campy sometimes.
1,That is a good movie, have you seen all three? The Dark Knight Trilogy. Yes. I saw all 3. They were good, though I was a bit disappointed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
1,I haven't seen the whole thing, but it involves wormholes. I heard it was a very good movie. What about movies like Gravity (2013) ?. I saw Gravity (2013) and thought it was pretty good.
1,I enjoy science fiction movies, especially ones with space ship combat.. Do you like the Star Wars movies especially?
1,Do you like the Star Wars movies especially?. They are not bad, but I tend to like Star Trek movies more. Star Wars movies seem more fantasy to me than science fiction.
1,Is that the Christopher Nolan movie? I have not seen it. Is it good, hard science fiction?. I haven't seen the whole thing, but it involves wormholes. I heard it was a very good movie. What about movies like Gravity (2013) ?
1,I enjoyed Christopher Nolan's other movie The Dark Knight (2008). That is a good movie, have you seen all three? The Dark Knight Trilogy

0,Yeah for sure. And I really don't want to see any more Kevin Hart movies!. But I like all kinds of movies. I love The Princess Bride (1987) , classics like On Golden Pond (1981)

1,Ok gotcha.. Yes, Philadelphia (1993) was so good. Another good one is Erin Brockovich (2000) . I don't think she was a lawyer though, maybe a paralegal. But it was one of my favorites for a while
1,Ok that's an older one right?. I also love lawyer movies like Philadelphia (1993)
0,Yes, having a hard time. @Planes,Trains and Automobiles. I do like that one, but I have seen it already, do you have another suggestion? I like horror, but not stuff like Annabelle (2014)
1,okay. Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986)
1,Would you mind suggesting one more and then we can be done here.. The Birds (1963) Did you ever see this one? It made my friend terrified of birds his whole life.
1,Youre doing good, just make sure your movie comes up when you start typing the @ sign. The Blair Witch Project (1999) This one scared me, because it was set where I grew up,lol!
1,Thanks. oh, because your Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986) didnt come up correctly it wouldnt submit. should be good now.
1,I have not seen the remake. What about Candyman (1992) I keep thinking of the classics. it is funny, i saw Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) in the theater when I was younger, but never saw the original. I think that is a great suggestion
1,Hi could you help me find a good scary movie? It could be a thriller or horror or even a drama that is scary. I liked Unfaithful (2002) a lot and that was more drama
1,I liked Unfaithful (2002) a lot and that was more drama. Yes have you seen A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)

1,I like the Indiana Jones movies as well. No. Stargate (1994) is a scifi movie staring Kurt Russel. I do also recommend Star Trek: First Contact (1996)
1,I love thrillers, sci-fi, fantasy, and comedy.. Have you seen Kiss the Girls (1997) ? It's an exciting thriller.

1,The scariest movie in recent years is The Babadook (2014). The Conjuring (2013) is good too
1,never saw it. any good?. I thought so. It's not as gritty as Primal Fear (1996) but it's got just an interesting of a story.
1,I agree. I thought Eddie Norton's character was a real victim. Until the ending, lol.. In a way, it was almost like The Lincoln Lawyer with Matthew Mcconoughy (however you spell it)
0,Oh okay. Maybe that's why I've never seen it.. Was he in Manhunter (1986) ?
0,ya! got that on dvd too. ive got almost all of anthony hopkins films. he does crazy well. scares me lol. He does. I've seen most all his movies except for Hannibal Rising (2007) .
1,lol guess we're the only ones on this morning. sunday is a slow day for hits anyway. It is. So about those movies, Primal Fear (1996) was good. Other than the villain winning what did you like?
1,Was he in Manhunter (1986) ?. nah but thats the movie Red Dragon (2002) is based on.
1,well that one yah but not many sequals surpass the original.. True true. Aliens (1986) was another one.

0,it does.. I've seen all the original except for Psycho III (1986)
1,yah me too. never got around to watching the third one. second was okay. not as shocking like the first. nothing ever beats the original. What about Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) ?

1,I think I started the first and it was ok and then I got overwhelmed at the rate they were releasing new ones. I think that's what happened to a lot of people. Myself included.

1,Ok, sounds good.. Not a typical black and white, but Pleasantville (1998) was really interesting
1,She liked Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) okay. Okay so maybe she'll like Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) then
1,Hello. Can you recommend a good action flick this evening?. Sure! Might I suggest Justice League (2017)

1,I will watch it for sure i have been wanting to. Also I suggest you watching Moulin Rouge! (2001) that has a great soundtrack!
1,Bridesmaids (2011) is another movie with a great soundtrack as well. I haven't seen that one yet! I love Joaquin. did you ever see To Die For (1995) with him and nicole kidman?

1,What about action movies? Any suggestions?. How about a 90s thriller: Speed (1994) .
1,I forgot what he said though.. What about American History X (1998) with Edward Norton? That's another good drama movie
1,Something like The Green Mile (1999). or The Shawshank Redemption (1994)
1,not really a thriller though. I also love Forrest Gump (1994) and Pulp Fiction (1994)
1,hmm. Something like The Green Mile (1999)
1,or The Shawshank Redemption (1994). I saw The Judge (2014) recently, with RDJ.
1,Fun? Well I will definitely check that out. Have you seen Catch Me If You Can (2002) ?
1,Ha very true. How About The Net (1995) , That's a 90s thriller. It's about a vast conspiracy on the Intenet, with very outdated technology.
1,Understandable.. How do you feel about Good Will Hunting (1997) ?
1,It is SO funny. I'm more into moves like Deadpool (2016) and Gia
0,I'm good thank you!. I recommend the Star Wars
1,I recommend The Big Sick (2017). I recommend Bad Moms (2016)
1,MTURK is great! how long u been turking?. I definitely will watch Office Christmas Party (2016)
0,I'm no really a star wars fan. I recommend The Big Sick (2017)
1,I've never seen or heard of that movie. Have you seen Office Christmas Party (2016) ?
1,Omg I have not seen it but I heard it was funny!. I like Deadpool (2016) !
1,LOL it was so nice to meet you have a good night!!. I live sci-fi but I am more of an Avatar (2009) fan than Star Wars
1,But set in war. I will check out Cold Mountain (2003)
1,I will check it out, ryan reynolds is so funny. have you see The House Bunny (2008)
1,Or maybe the movie Just Friends (2005) ? Bothe with Ryan Reynolds and they are hilarious. have you seen Titanic (1997)
1,anna ferris is so funny. What about Cold Mountain (2003) that is another Romance movie

1,I am good thank you.. Have you seen The Proposal (2009) ?
1,are you going to see Star Wars the last jedi?. My Best Friend's Wedding (1997) in another classic with Julia rOBERTS
1,No, this mechaGodzilla is built by the government using a dead Godzilla's bones.. There's also a sequel, Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. (2003)
1,any time period. I haven't seen them since childhood. :). Okay, well one of my favorites is Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla (1994) .
1,Oh okay. I might check that out simply because the concept sounds intriguing. :). Also, there's a newer version of mechaGodzilla in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla (2002) . It's a japanese release, but great!
1,lol,. There's also a new Japanese release called Shin Godzilla (2016) . I'm not too sure about the storyline, but I think its one where a godzilla dies then gets reborn. I havent seen this one yet, but hear it's pretty good.
1,Okay. I'll check it out. Is it on DVD like the others?. No, that one is in theaters. But if you want something on DVD, try Hidden Figures (2016) . I LOVED it! It's about the black women who worked for NASA.
1,It's a typical stalker/fatal attraction movie. Kind of like Obsessed (2009) starring Beyonce and Morris Chestnut, but instead this time, a woman is being stalked.. Another good choice is No Good Deed (2014) with Idris Elba. It's like the other two as well.
1,Oh okay. Wow. I havent seen any of these.. I've only seen Obsessed (2009) but not the other two. But I hear they're good.
1,Not sure how helpful I'll be there, but I'll give it a go.. Oh wait! Have you seen The Perfect Guy (2015) ?
1,No, what's that about?. It's a typical stalker/fatal attraction movie. Kind of like Obsessed (2009) starring Beyonce and Morris Chestnut, but instead this time, a woman is being stalked.
1,That's more my speed. It's been a while since I've seen it though.. That's okay. Nothing wrong with that. Have you seen All the Right Moves (1983) with Tom Cruise?
1,No, never seen that either.. It's a really great film. You'll love it. Kind of like Regarding Henry (1991) but with race cars.
1,Sadly I haven't. Is it good?. Yes. If you liked Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) you'll like this one.
1,No, too risque for me. Okay, what about Sleepless in Seattle (1993) ? Hanks and Ryan?
0,After. Okay, How about Indecent Proposal (1993) ? Demi Moor and Woodie Harrleson.
1,Yes. If you liked Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) you'll like this one.. And while we're on Cruise, what about Days of Thunder (1990) ?
1,A good movie knows no time period. That's right. Have you seen The Omen (1976) ?
1,I am one of those people who used to dismiss older movies because of the quality of film making, but as I've grown older, I see that they often tell much better stories than films today. Oh yeah, definitely. A more recent one that you might like is Paranormal Activity (2007) .
1,I haven't seen the remake, so I can't compare the two. But, the original is really good and keeps you in suspense until the end.. What about Psycho (1960) ? It's a classic Hitchcock film.
1,Any classics featuring vampires or strange creatres?. Oh yeah. I love the classics. Have you seen Cat People (1942) ?
1,and a little sad, lol. Yeah, it is. She warned him not to make her fall in love, but he didn't listen. I assume you've probably seen the original Dracula (1931) ?
1,I have seen that one. As well as Father of the Bride (1950). I've also enjoyed The Reckless Moment (1949)
1,I'm looking for some good films noir.. Ooh my favorite genre. Have you seen Scarlet Street (1945) with Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett?

1,Though Murray only does a voice over in the second choice.. Both are good movies in fact I own @TheJungleBook and I have seen Ghostbusters (1984) many times
1,I'm really fond of the second. Scarlet Johansson is in it. It's about 2 people who meet in Tokyo to produce a commercial but find love and solace in one another.. And while we're on the subject of love, Her (2013) starring Joaquin Phoenix is another good one
1,Not really it just all depends if the plot sounds good. Since you like family oriented comedy, I'll suggest a few of my favorites of Bill Murray. Can't go wrong with Ghostbusters (1984) and The Jungle Book (2016) .
1,Both are good movies in fact I own @TheJungleBook and I have seen Ghostbusters (1984) many times. OH okay. Great then! What about Broken Flowers (2005) or Lost in Translation (2003) ? They lean a little more to the adult in terms of theme, but are good in my opinion.

1,okay how about Warrior (2007). Good Will Hunting (1997)

1,Political dramas I should say.. okay how about Warrior (2007)
1,seen that one. warrior is better though. I've seen American Beauty (1999) . I enjoyed it
1,it is the holiday season so maybe The Polar Express (2004) or my favorite Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). A great holiday movie as well is Love Actually (2003)
1,Not to be confused with The Polar Express (2004) , which is another good one.. it is the holiday season so maybe The Polar Express (2004) or my favorite Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)

1,I haven't seen that one. Well, I hope you liked the suggestions. Have a good day.. I have only seen bits and pieces of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
1,I suppose good science fiction movies that don't deal with superheroes.. Have you seen Soylent Green (1973) ? It's a classic
1,I have not, although I do know the twist already.. Oh ok. I'm sure you've probably seen E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
1,That one was so-so, the 60's, 70's, and 80's Science-Fiction movies have a bigger appeal; not always, but mostly.. Oh ok, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) is a good one
0,Yes, I have seen that one and thought it was pretty good.. Not sure if it's considered sci-fi, but Gravity (2013) is a pretty good movie
1,Oh ok, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) is a good one. Interstellar (2014) was very good for example

1,Okay, Looper (2012) is a good sci fi movie with Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Avatar (2009) is another classic sci fi movie where the graphics are really good
1,Think I will try Looper sounds interesting. The movie with Bruce Willis is about the future and about a hitman. It's crazy but ties in together really well. There's also that new movie with Ryan Gosling called Blade Runner 2049 (2017)
1,Looper sounds like a good movie. If you like Amy Adams Arrival (2016) is another interesting sci fi movie
1,Hello I am looking to watch some syfi action movies. Okay, Looper (2012) is a good sci fi movie with Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt

1,It is. And it's just as good.. I would also recommend The Snowman (2017) with Michael Fassbender. It's sort of like Seven (1995) where the cop plays a cat and mouse game with a serial killer

1,That one threw me for a loop when I watched it.. Have you seen The Sixth Sense (1999) ?
1,I have never heard of it, I will have to add it to my list.. The Butterfly Effect (2004) is an amazing movie too. It makes you question a lot.

1,My little one has seen that one already and he didnt like it. Oh ok. Finding Nemo (2003) is another one.

1,I'm interested in action movies like The Italian Job (2003). I like action movies too, have you seen The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) ?
1,Let's try and think of something more recent.. Well I really did enjoy Logan (2017) .
1,Great!. I'm interested in action movies like The Italian Job (2003)
1,We have watched it several times though. Perhaps something else?. How about How to Train Your Dragon ? It's a great family movie!
1,In case they get scared?. Sure thing! Another good one is Moana (2016)
1,Perhaps something animated like Sing (2016). Have you seen The Secret Life of Pets (2016) ?

1,I really like that actor.. And I haven't seen Dr. Strange
1,I certainly could. What's your favorite one?. I liked Two Weeks Notice .
1,I did like that one!. Another movie like The Avengers (2012) would be Dr. Strange .
1,Do you like any other movies?. I think tonight I will watch Dr. Strange
1,but for super hero movies i liked The Avengers (2012). Oh, so you like the romcoms. Okay, what about Click (2006) ?
1,Think we can come up with something more up beat?. Bad Moms (2016) would be a good laugh
1,Something in the romcom ball park would be good.. I liked Miss Congeniality (2000) if that helps you understand my tastes.
0,Can you help?. The Notebook (2013) is a date night staple!
1,I liked Miss Congeniality (2000) if that helps you understand my tastes.. How about Love Actually (2003)
0,Do you have a back up suggestion for me?. If that doesn't work out for you, try watching Goodfellas (1990) .

1,DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004) is very good, but it is different from Bad Moms (2016) .. How about A Bad Moms Christmas (2017) ?
0,That's an interesting timeline. I had never thought of the time effect. Should we say good-bye?. I wasn't really a fan of Paranormal Activity (2007) either. Yes, I think so. This is my first time doing these, so I'm still learning the process.
0,I'll definitely check that one out!. How about The Blair Bitch Project (1999) ? Did you see that? Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films.
0,I am not that old.. Ohh....those are good ones. I'm watching The Purge: Anarchy (2014) right now and it's horrible.
1,Mother! (2017) looked good, what did you not like about it?. Very disjointed in a way that I found boring. I was wondering if my younger self would have found it profound. However, I can always throw back to The Shining (1980) . Or Psycho (1960)
0,Yikes. The drop down menu has that misspelled!. Ehh....I lived in a small town when The Blair Witch Project (1999) came out and by the time it made it to our theater I'd already seen all the parodies of it. And it was in a theater full of people who screamed and freaked out. I think If I'd seen it earlier then I'd have liked it.
1,But I can do a recent recommendation.. It doesn't matter! Have you watched the Romeo + Juliet (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio? I liked it but I swear the whole ending where she literally opened her eyes and saw him drink the poison was just crazy lol
1,It doesn't matter! Have you watched the Romeo + Juliet (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio? I liked it but I swear the whole ending where she literally opened her eyes and saw him drink the poison was just crazy lol. Romeo + Juliet (1996) is the reason I auditioned for Tybalt last year. I didn't get it, but I still got a fun part.

1,Sure, no problem! Are you looking for something more modern then, like Tangled? Or a classic? Because if it's classic and something I'm sure isn't too memorized, I can suggest Fantasia (1940) as Walt DIsney's third major disney film! It's mainly about Mickey Mouse and includes a wide range of classical tracks!. However, if something like Tangled (2010) is more of your taste, I highly recommend Coco (2017) .

1,do you know any good romantic comedies?. My girlfriend recently got me into John Hughs films. Sixteen Candles (1984) was surprising good.
1,If you're into indie, I'd also recommend My Life in Ruins (2009) . It's a pretty &quot;by-the-books&quot; rom-com (woman is in a rut and embraces her inner fun to find love and happiness), but it's still a decently solid film by Nia Vardolous (writer and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding).. I haven't seen Friends with Benefits (2011) , but I've heard good things about it.
1,Just go to your home. I love it haha. Another great film was The Waterboy (1998)
1,Not really a fan of his new stuff. Ok so a few great films see with him would be Happy Gilmore (1996)
1,oh yeah. Great one. Spanglish (2004) was a curveball for him. I liked it, but it was hard to have him be serious
1,Its with Drew Barymore and great old time feels. Hmmmm You're a tough one haha have you seen 50 First Dates (2004)
1,I hope you have a good day. Have you seen that film The Wedding Singer (1998)
1,love comedy. i loved Big Daddy (1999)
1,Spanglish (2004) was a curveball for him. I liked it, but it was hard to have him be serious. Big Daddy (1999) is surely his best film in my opinion

1,What is your taste at the moment ☺. MY favorite is Speed (1994)
1,I don't think I've seen that one yet. it's good. Similar humor to Happy Gilmore (1996) and an underdog story, but I'd argue a little more heartwarming and less slapstick
1,Thought that was a sweet movie.. I heard very mixed things about that one. I haven't cared too much for Adam Sandler past Click (2006) , and even then that movie was just too sad for rewatching lol
1,Something with Adam Sandler. I am a huge fan of The Longest Yard (2005) , the remake

0,Have you gone back to the series roots with Mad Max (1979) ?. My favorite is Mad Max 2 (1981) , but Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) isn't bad either.

1,The last movie I watched that I really enjoyed was Suicide Squad (2016) although I was a little late to the game with that.. I was surprised at how much I liked it. I also watched Dunkirk (2017) recently and enjoyed it as well.

It's about a girl who is convinced that she is a cyborg and is sent to a mental institution. It's definitely off beat and pretty funny.

1,I'm looking for some comedy, or horror movies to watch tonight...like Idle Hands (1999) or Half Baked (1998). Sixteen Candles (1984) and Home Alone (1990) were great 80's classics.
1,Sixteen Candles (1984) and Home Alone (1990) were great 80's classics.. Or you might try Real Genius (1985) and Weird Science (1985) e for some laughs.
1,Ooh, I've yet to see Sixteen Candles (1984) but have been told to watch it, so I'll add that to the list! I love all of the Home Alone movies, but mostly the first 2 of them. Home Alone 3 (1997) was alright, but I didn't care for Home Alone 4 much at all.. I haven't seen Real Genius (1985) or Weird Science (1985) but I've been told to watch those as well, as the names seem familiar. Thanks for the great suggestions!

1,Great funny movie. That's one I've heard great things about too, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (2010)
1,It was great talking with you. I loved BASEketball (1998) have you ever seen that?
1,Sure. Star! (1968) is a musical, and it's a biography of Gertrude Lawrence, who was a broadway star (I believe)
1,I mistyped the other, or selected the wrong film from the list, as I meant Funny Girl (1968) not Fun (1994). Funny Girl (1968) is another musical as well, in a biographical romantic format
1,Hmm, how about Gone with the Wind (1939) ?. or The Wizard of Oz (1939) ?
1,Of course!. Mary Poppins (1964) and West Side Story (1961) are both classics!
1,Can I suggest some flicks for you to watch?. I'm looking for movies like The Sound of Music (1965)

1,or The Wizard of Oz (1939) ?. I actually haven't seen Gone with the Wind (1939) , but it's on my watch list
1,Alright, let me think. How about Fun (1994) or Star! (1968)
1,Star! (1968) is a musical, and it's a biography of Gertrude Lawrence, who was a broadway star (I believe). I mistyped the other, or selected the wrong film from the list, as I meant Funny Girl (1968) not Fun (1994)
1,I loved Pineapple Express (2008) and The Naked Gun is outright hillarious!. It makes me think of Airplane! (1980)
1,Great suggestion!. I loved Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003) too!
1,Have you seen Dumb and Dumber (1994) cause honestly I think that one fits em all. Especially horror!. That's a great flick! I haven't seen Dumb and Dumber (1994)
1,I loved Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003) too!. Pineapple Express (2008) might be the same way. As well as The Naked Gun . My husband loves that goofy stuff
1,I like comedies a lot, but also like drama, horror, and action adventure. Have you seen Dumb and Dumber (1994) cause honestly I think that one fits em all. Especially horror!

1,Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). how about Interstellar (2014) ?

1,that was another film I really liked.. or Starman (1984) ?

1,But nothing like Alien (1979) where the aliens are trying to eat humans.. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
1,I saw Interstellar (2014) but it got a bit complex for me.. You know, I saw Starman (1984) a really long time ago and forgot about it. I really liked it.
0,what is another example of one that you liked?. But nothing like Alien (1979) where the aliens are trying to eat humans.
1,Oh, I really liked that one.. Also Cloverfield (2008) might be good.
1,Hi, I really like exciting thriller movies. Do you know any good ones?. My favorites are Taken (2008) .
1,Pretty sure they're related.. I also liked Arrival (2016) .
1,I saw the sequel, was trying to find the name of it.. I meant 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) .
1,Oh my gosh I have a great one then. It's called A Cure for Wellness (2017) . It scared me out of my mind
1,yes that was a good one too. And Cape Fear (1991) . That one was crazy. You've probably seen it though
1,Yes, but I would love to rewatch it. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) was really good and had some weird twists

0,Love that movie!. Have you seen Seven (1995) or The Prisoner (2013) ?
1,The Fugitive (2003) was also really good. For an action/thriller, you could always try The Taking of Pellham 123. Either The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) or the original it was based on, The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009) .

1,You'll love it then!. I loved him in Inception (2010) .
1,It was dark at parts, but mostly pretty light hearted. Lots of action and the characters are a little more interesting and unique than the typical Marvel films!. Dear John (2010) is a quite excellent drama I just watched, really got the tear ducts working.

1,Hello.. I'm looking to see a good action film like Baby Driver (2017)
1,Ah, the first one is just a long title. Has Wesley Snipers in drag lol. Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) is the superior movie, admittedly. However, both are worth watching.
1,I suppose if you are looking for action movies with a light British feel and a good soundtrack, Kingsman: The Golden Circle. I have not seen the first two you have mentioned, but I liked The Birdcage (1996)
