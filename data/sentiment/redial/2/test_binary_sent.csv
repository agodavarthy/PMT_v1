1,If only she could have moved over a bit on that piece of wood. LOL. I really enjoyed Love Actually (2003)
1,Yes, that is a great love story. It's sad, but I still think it has a feel-good aspect at the end seeing her grow old.. How about Pretty Woman (1990) that's a classic?
1,LOVE the scene where the boy goes to stop his girl in the airport.. And, Dirty Dancing . Patrick Swayze...That's all you have to say and I love it. :) It's great.
1,LMBO!. Oh, yes! Love Pretty Woman (1990) , and I haven't seen it in awhile.
0,I'm interested in seeing a love story. Something like When Harry Met Sally... (1989) . Any ideas?. I'm not in the mood for something too sad, like Love Story (1970) , though.
1,I'm not in the mood for something too sad, like Love Story (1970) , though.. Oh nice, how about Titanic (2012)

1,Oh yes I like that movie.. or Resident Evil
1,How about some action movies.. Men in Black
1,Hi, what is a good action movie?. i like Fast & Furious (2009)
1,If you like action movies that are also sci-fi, there's Star Wars (1977) and sequels.. Jumanji (2017) is family friendly.
1,Actually, we watch the older Jumanji (2017) about once a year. We haven't seen the new Jumanji (2017) . Maybe we'll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion! We do like Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) too.. There's also a sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) .
1,Okay.. If you like action movies that are also sci-fi, there's Star Wars (1977) and sequels.
1,Jumanji (2017) is family friendly.. Yes, I did like all of the Star Wars (1977) s movies. Our family loves Jumanji (2017) . We watch it about once a year. I also like Paycheck (2003) .
1,There's also a sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) .. I thought I selected the older Jumanji (1995) . Oops!
1,How about Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) ?. Actually, we watch the older Jumanji (2017) about once a year. We haven't seen the new Jumanji (2017) . Maybe we'll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion! We do like Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) too.

1,Ah, okay. Have you seen The Others (2001) ? It's a great horror movie, too.. Suspiria (1977) is set in a dance school in Germany that is also a witch's coven. It's very stylized 70s horror with a great soundtrack.
1,The Shape of Water (2017) was awesome! Have you seen any of Guillermo del Toro's other stuff, like Pan's Labyrinth (2006) ?. No, I did see that. I really enjoyed The Other (1972) and I also liked The Hatching (2016)
1,It's great. The The Other (1972) from 72

1,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) is cheesy but fun, and it is heavy on the costumes and scenery.. I've seen Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and I loved the costumes in that, too
1,I like costume dramas as well, and Mary Reilly (1996) has a ton of costumes. Corsets and brocade everywhere. Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is very well done. Set in the victorian era, very well directed and photographed.
1,I liked both of those! I also liked The Others (2001). The Shining (1980) is the early 80s... which I guess is the past now... Jeez, I feel old lol
1,There are the classics, like The Shining (1980) and The Sixth Sense (1999). I liked both of those! I also liked The Others (2001)
1,Nice! Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) is one of my favorites, too. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) is cheesy but fun, and it is heavy on the costumes and scenery.

1,The Shining (1980) is the early 80s... which I guess is the past now... Jeez, I feel old lol. I have not seen The Others (2001)
1,I also like some of the Japanese horror movies that have ghosts. It's not a ghost story, but it is a good horror flick set in the past... Mary Reilly (1996) is about Dr. Jekyl's maid.
1,Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is very well done. Set in the victorian era, very well directed and photographed.. Nice! Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) is one of my favorites, too
1,Gary Oldman has some pretty fabulous looks going on in that one for sure.. Still haven't seen Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) , but I need to put that back on my radar. Thanks for the suggestion!

1,Seen it and love it.. How about the The Matrix (1999)
1,Thanks how about a great sci-fi?. Like Blade Runner (1982)
1,I was just about to recommend that one! Great minds think alike!. Have you seen Alien (1979)
0,Hmm... now that we've been talking about suspense, I want something in that genre to watch.. lol I understand. Well what about Get Out (2017) ? It's not very horrific but it's good and psychological.
1,I've seen it. I didn't like it as much as I would thought.. I thought it would have been more like The Bone Collector (1999) .
1,Sure can! Just last night I saw Jigsaw (2017) . It's good, but not as good as the previous movies in the franchise.. You mean Saw (2004) ?
1,Yes. Those movies are better in my opinion.. I've also seen It (2017) . It's a remake of the original. It's pretty good. Especially if you liked the original.
1,Can you recommend a few?. Sure can! Just last night I saw Jigsaw (2017) . It's good, but not as good as the previous movies in the franchise.
1,I thought it would have been more like The Bone Collector (1999) .. I see. Well in that case you want to check out Zodiac (2007) . That's very good. Very similar to Denzel's film but it's about the BTK killer
1,Can you help me?. Yes. Have you seen The Babadook (2014) ? It's very unique and a bit odd but overall very scary
1,I don't know. It's very frustrating. The new ones all seem to have little plot. I also would recommend Hush (2016) .
1,No I haven't. But I've heard good things about it. That's its very psychological. I loved it! Have you seen A Tale of Two Sisters (2003)
1,I also liked that one. I thought it was super scary. And of course, there is The Shining (1980) but I'm sure you've seen it
1,And of course, there is The Shining (1980) but I'm sure you've seen it. Yes, I've seen The Shining (1980) . I wonder why they don't make horror films as suspenseful anymore.

1,Gravity (2013) is amazing also. I also like The Martian (2015) with Matt Damon.

1,No, it is very different. It is about a little girl that becomes a troll, and her family doesn't realize it, but the brother finds out. The troll is the antagonist.. Oh, I thought it might be like Trolls (2016) where the Trolls are good guys.
1,I like to see movies from all categories, so maybe, I will have a good recommendation.. I like all kinds. Fantasy are my favorite, like The Sixth Sense (1999)
1,I have never see Troll (1986) . Is it like The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) ?. I like the Quiet man. It has John Wayne. You know, from The Searchers (1956) .

1,What is the second one? A comedy?. Yes. A Woody Allen film. If you love Airplane! (1980) you'll like The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)
1,Never seen that one either.. I do not usually watch Woody Allen, but I do like Airplane! (1980) and movies like those.
1,then I will be set!. Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult (1994) ? I would hunt down The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977) . Youll love it
1,I like comedies. Do you know any older ones then?. Do you like silly stuff like Airplane! (1980) or more thoughtful comedies, like Annie Hall (1977) ?

1,I have not seen that one.. I liked Bale as Batman Begins
1,What are a few more like his?. with him in them or another actor? Because Kickboxer (1989) was also pretty awesome.
1,That sounds really good. Like a dark version of O Brother, Where Art Thou%3F (2000) or at least the part where the guy sells his soul.. haha. yeah! but that would be the only part. Think of Spawn (1997) but before it was a thing
1,I am looking for that exact genre!. I always love a good action movie! One of my favorites of all time is Jean Claude Vann Damme's Lionheart (1987) . It was such a cool martial arts action based movie

1,I have! it is the best movie ever!. Inception (2010) was good its not a comic movie tho
1,I'm looking for a comedy. Maybe something like Little Miss Sunshine (2006)

1,Maybe something like Little Miss Sunshine (2006). Have you seen Office Space (1999) ?

1,I do like the newer ones. I'm not sure. I get confused with those sometimes. There are so many. The only one I can remember clearly is Freddy vs. Jason (2003) but I think that is the wrong slasher film series.
1,It was good! I loved the old It (1990) too. Awesome. I loved The Notebook (2013) .

1,I have heard of Airplane! (1980) though, but not that familiar with the others. There is The Death of Stalin which is in cinema as we speak
1,Or The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988) is more absurd. Anything more recent like Central Intelligence (2016)
1,There is The Death of Stalin which is in cinema as we speak. Sounds interesting. I'll have to check The Death of Stalin out

1,Thanks for all of your help. I appreciate the suggestions. They are all very good ones.. and Kagemusha (1980) is an medieval japanese dram which is definitively not a romantic comedy

1,except Adam Sandler is more stable. Oh that's cool, I liked Punch-Drunk Love (2002)
1,Just like Jim Carrey in The Majestic (2001) , that one surprised me. and in I Love You Phillip Morris (2009)

1,Hi! I'm looking for animation movies to watch.. Disney's Moana (2016) was a good film.
1,Haven't seen that one. I'll have to check it out.. While we're talking classics, don't forget about Pinocchio (1967) .
1,I've seen them too! Really good.. A classic would be Disney's Jungle Book (1942) . It's older but still great.
1,I heard that was pretty good.. Life (2017)
1,how about Arrival (2016). Okja looks like a weird one but good lol

1,OK. What else can you suggest?. There is also Lost in Translation (2003) and Moonrise Kingdom (2012) , both with Bill MurrY TOO.
1,I didn't like Lost in Translation (2003) . Moonrise Kingdom (2012) was great.. Have you seen Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986) ?

1,You are welcome! Of course!. I like The Fog (1980) . Is it similar?
1,Sounds good to me.. Do you like historical dramas with action? The Beast (1996) helps explain how the war in Afghanistan drained so much from our country and people, and helped lead the the crash of the economy in 1991, and our collapse. It's western made but well done.

1,I have not heard of those.. What's Paul (2011) about?. The Ridiculous 6 (2015) is an Adam Sandler western that's pretty funny. Paul (2011) is about two nerds on a road trip that stubble across a real alien who just happens to be rude, crude and trying to go home.

1,I have seen both of those I enjoyed them a lot.. James Franco plays in Why Him%3F (2016) and does a great job!
1,Yes Ive seen both of those also pretty funny. Anything more recent? Or maybe an old forgotten comedy ?. The new Jumanji (2017) movie was really funny!
1,Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016) was really good too. They made the hatter looks NUTS in that one. I didn't get a chance to see that one, but I also saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) with Johnny Depp, and I'm pretty sure that is also a Tim Burton movie. That was also a good film.
1,I agree, he is what I would think a mad hatter should look like.. Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016) was really good too. They made the hatter looks NUTS in that one

1,Have you seen Bad Moms (2016) ?. They had a Christmas one too that was at least as funny as the original. It was A Bad Moms Christmas (2017) .
1,Hello, I'm looking for some funny movies. Can you help? Something like Bridesmaids (2011). Have you seen Bad Moms (2016) ?
1,She did Black Swan (2010) too. It's not a comedy. Not even close but she did a fantastic job with it. OH i Forgot she was in Black Swan (2010) Thanks for reminding me! I'll watch that!
1,Hi there what kind of movies are you looking for?. Hello, I'm looking for some funny movies. Can you help? Something like Bridesmaids (2011)

1,I like a good action movie! That sounds crazy? Do you know of any more like that?. I like Liam Neeson, like Taken (2008) , and Taken 2 (2012) .
1,I haven't seen either of those. I don't guess I watch much Liam Neeson. Not that I don't like him just cause he wasn't on my radar. He is very well rounded from Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) , to Schindler's List (1993) he does it all.
1,I had considered A Wrinkle in Time but I am not sure. I have too, I was thinking of going last week, but ended up watching The Hunt for Red October (1990) instead.
0,That sounds like a good movie. I have heard good things about it anyway!. I had considered A Wrinkle in Time but I am not sure
1,Oh either would be ok!. Annihilation (2018) looks like it's good.
1,but australia invaded by chinese. The only thing better is Dirty Dancing
1,Red Dawn (1984) is class Swayze.. here is an interesting one.. Tomorrow, When the War Began .. same as red dawn
1,Ok, great.. how about Predator .. same year.. if it bleeds we can kill it?. or the original Red Dawn (2012) .. cheesy but fun
1,I really like old Arnold like The Running Man (1987). Ok, great.. how about Predator .. same year.. if it bleeds we can kill it?
1,Hi, action, something older would be better.. I really like old Arnold like The Running Man (1987)
1,true.. haha. Red Dawn (1984) is class Swayze.
1,I think I've seen that one, is it a bunch of teens on a camping trip or something?. true..or Point Break (1991) .. ultimate swayze movie
1,or the original Red Dawn (2012) .. cheesy but fun. Such a good film. Although the second one. Predator 2 (1990) is laughably bad.
1,Okay well I am tapped out on suggestions.. Yes James and the Giant Peach (1996) was really pretty wasn't it
1,Can I recommend some movies?. Hi there! I like movies like Cars (2006) and The Secret Life of Pets (2016)

1,Great visual movie but put me to sleep.. I have seen that one it was cute and I loved the weird little demon things in Hercules (1997)
1,Or The Usual Suspects (1995) ?. Or The Usual Suspects (1995) ?
1,That was great.. Or The Usual Suspects (1995) ?
1,Or however you spell it. Spacey is a pig unfortunately. Or Secret Window (2004)
1,Like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011). how about House of Games (1987) ... ?
1,Psychological thrillers. Like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)
1,I haven’t seen that one.. Have you seen Limitless (2011) ?
1,Or Secret Window (2004). Or Secret Window (2004)
1,I did. I've watched it a couple of times now. I did see The Martian (2015) , it was really good.
1,Maybe Space Cowboys (2000) ? I liked that one too.. I like Chris Pratt, he was good in The Magnificent Seven (2016) .
1,I have, I was not very fond of it. Did you like it?. The Martian (2015) is really good too though I don't know if either of those qualify as action
1,Can't really go wrong with Denzel.. My husband like Cowboys & Aliens (2011) . Harrison Ford and all
0,Action and sci-fi mostly.. Have you seen Passengers (2016) ?
1,Well they're not really the same. The new ones aren't written by Lucas anymore I don't think. I don't think so either. Byt The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is an amazing film.
1,Hi there! I am looking for movies like Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) Do you have any recommendations?. Star Wars (1977) films are always great. I usually take a Saturday and watch as many as I can starting with the old ones.
1,I don't think so either. Byt The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is an amazing film.. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is classic and amazing I agree
